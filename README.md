## Business Problem üö©
The electronics superstore operates across multiple locations and an online store, generating vast amounts of transactional data. However, several challenges impact business efficiency and profitability:  

- **Revenue Optimization:** The company lacks clear visibility into which products and locations contribute the most to revenue, making it difficult to allocate resources effectively.  
- **Customer Demand Trends:** Without data-driven insights, predicting customer preferences and demand fluctuations is challenging.  
- **Store Performance Analysis:** Comparing the performance of different stores and identifying underperforming locations is difficult due to fragmented data.  
- **Inventory Management:** Inefficient tracking of high-demand products and slow-moving inventory leads to lost sales opportunities and excess stock.  
- **Sales Channel Effectiveness:** Understanding the sales contribution from physical stores versus online channels is essential for strategic planning.  

By analyzing this retail sales dataset, the project aims to uncover meaningful insights that can help the business improve profitability, streamline operations, and enhance customer satisfaction.  
By leveraging **Power BI and Excel**, this analysis helps stakeholders understand key revenue drivers and optimize business strategies.

## Project Objective üéØ
This project aims to analyze and optimize the retail sales performance of an electronics superstore by leveraging data analytics. The dataset consists of transactional sales data from multiple store locations and an online platform. The primary objectives of this analysis are:  

1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation** ‚Äì Ensure data integrity by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies across multiple tables.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äì Identify key sales trends, product performance, and customer purchasing behavior through statistical and visual analysis.  
3. **SQL-Based Business Insights** ‚Äì Utilize SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as top-selling products, revenue trends by region, and store performance comparisons.  
4. **Data Modeling & Relationship Mapping** ‚Äì Establish connections between product categories, sales transactions, warranty claims, and store locations for better analysis.  
5. **Dashboard & Data Visualization** ‚Äì Create an interactive Power BI dashboard to present insights in a clear and actionable manner, aiding strategic decision-making.

## Project Structure

## 1. Data Preparation (Microsoft Excel): 
- Data understanding, exploration, data loading, data importing.
- Check dataset structure using Column Headers & Data Types
- Standardizing Data Formats

##  2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation in Power BI (Power Query)**  

#### **Introduction**  
Data cleaning is a crucial step before analysis, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and completeness. In this project, Power BI‚Äôs **Power Query Editor** is used to clean and transform the retail sales dataset. This document outlines the detailed steps taken to prepare the data for analysis.  

#### **Step 1: Removing Duplicates**  
- Identify key columns where duplicates should not exist (e.g., `Order Number` , `ProductKey` , `Storekey` , `Customerkey`).  
- Select the column ‚Üí Click **Remove Duplicates** in the ribbon.  
- Verify the row count before and after removal.

                                            **Image Showing Duplicate Removal Process**

#### **Step 2: Standardizing Data Formats**  
- Ensure numerical fields (e.g., `Sales`, `Quantity`) are in **Decimal Number** format.  
- Convert categorical fields (e.g., `Product Name`) to **Text** format.  
- Convert date fields (`Transaction Date`) to **Date** format.  
  - **Home** ‚Üí **Data Type** ‚Üí Select **Date**  
- Standardize text formatting:  
  - Convert to **Proper Case** (e.g., "laptop" ‚Üí "Laptop") using:  
    ```powerquery
    Text.Proper([Product Name])
    ```

                                            **Image Showing Format Standardizing Process**
#### **Step 3: Handling Missing Values**  
##### **A. Identifying Missing Data**  
- Click on each column and check for **null** values in the data preview.  
- Use **Filter** to check missing entries. 

#### Step 4: Loading Clean Data into Power BI
Click Close & Apply to load the cleaned dataset into Power BI for visualization.

## Project Data Modelling
The goal was to build a **star schema** to enhance query performance and enable meaningful analysis.
#### Step 1: Creating Date Table For Time Data Analysis
```DAX
Date = 
VAR StartDate = DATE(2016, 1, 1)  -- Change to your preferred start date
VAR EndDate = TODAY()  -- Uses today's date as the end date
RETURN CALENDAR(StartDate, EndDate)
```
- Extract neccessary columns from `Date` column

                                            **Image Showing Completed Date Table**

### Step 2: Defining Relationships
#### **Primary & Foreign Keys**
To establish relationships:
- **Sales Table** ‚Üí Linked to `Products Table` using `ProductKey`.
- **Sales Table** ‚Üí Linked to `Stores Table` using `StoreKey`.
- **Sales Table** ‚Üí Linked to `Customers Table` using `CustomerKey`.
- **Sales Table** ‚Üí Linked to `Date Table` using `Order Date` as primary relationship and `Delivery Date` as secondary relationship.

```DAX
Total Revenue = SUM(Sales[Revenue])
```
- 2. Revenue Percentage Share
```DAX 
DIVIDE([Revenue], CALCULATE([Revenue], ALL(stores[Country])), 0)
```
![Screenshot (54)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e63d1398-b885-4026-81c6-58369454cae3)

- 3. Orders Count
```DAX 
SUM(Sales[Quantity])
```
![Screenshot (58)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9186ed80-04df-4a09-8b57-bb8602f721c1)
##### Analysis: Heatmap Visual shows Sales always decrease by about 35% around March - April and Gradually pickups around May**, showing shopping trends, and Peaks by December - February.

- 4. Top product Sales In Each Country
```DAX 
Top Country (Product) = 
VAR ProductSalesByCountry =  
    SUMMARIZE(
